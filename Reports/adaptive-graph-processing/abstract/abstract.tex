\begin{abstract}

The analysis of connected data has become more important, due to the increasing prevalence of
graph-modelled data sources, such as social media and internet-connected devices. The rate at which
these graphs are growing is unlikely to slow down as technology reaches a greater and greater
proportion of the world's population, meaning that the cost of offline analysis of these graphs will
continue to increase.
\linebreak
We present an adaptive solution to graph-data analytics using online edge and vertex clustering, which
acheieves comparable performance to pre-processing methods, but without any pre-processing step. 
Users will be able to gather real-time insights from their connected data, using high speed queries
enabled by online restructuring, rather than having to perform periodic, costly, offline analysis.
