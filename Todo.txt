Research current in-memory representations of graph databases
  2017.12.23: Barely

For a given query determine the fix-point for the database. Attempt a prove
that this is in fact optimal.
  2017.12.23: No

Develop algorithms which ensure that queries to the database bring the
structure closer to the fix-point. Attempt to prove that they do.
  2017.12.23: No

Implement cracking for a RDB.
  2017.12.23: crack_in_two and crack_in_three both done for decomposed
              multi-column tables.

Model a graph database system on the RDB.
  2017.12.23: Supports selection and insertion only, and only selection uses
              the cracker index.

Implement some graph algorithms on the cracked graph wrapped RDB.
  2017.12.23: BFS

Get/generate some data for running some graph algorithms with a non-trivial
running time.
  2017.12.23: BFS

Run some performance benchmarks with the graph algorithm implementations on the
cracked RDB using the data.
  2017.12.23: BFS

Implement a minimal graph database and the algorithms defined earlier in some
high-performance programming language (probably Rust)
  2017.12.23: No

Implement the earlier graph algorithms using this system.
  2017.12.23: No

Run performance benchmarks using the same data used to benchmark the RDB
system.
