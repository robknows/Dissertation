In no particular order:

- Prove correctness for crack_in three and crack_in_two

- Change implementation to work for float columns (may require changes to inclusivity handling)

- Change implementation to re-index all columns of a table, so it works for multi-column tables

- Using an adjacency list, implement BFS
