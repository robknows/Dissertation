Analysis of connected data is becoming increasingly valuable in the world[REF], as social media and vast computer networks consisting of phones and other web-connected devices become ubiquitous[REF]. These increasingly large data mining tasks will require high-speed graph database queries to provide the answers to questions which will enable software providers to deliver value to consumers.

There are currently not many indexing techniques available for graph databases - many use index-free adjacency[REF] or a hybrid index on the edges[REF]. There are however adaptive restructuring techniques available for graph databases in at least one recent PhD[REF].

Our plan for implementing adaptive processing is to first choose a graph indexing technique and then figure out how that index can be constructed on-the-fly from incoming queries. We will then benchmark the system we produce against other potential techniques for solving our problem.
