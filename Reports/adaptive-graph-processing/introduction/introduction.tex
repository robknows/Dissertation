\section{The Growth of Connected Data Sources}

Since 2010 the internet has grown by over 200,000 users every year\footnote{\url{http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/}}. The countries which have seen the largest change
proportional to their population are countries in asia with large rural populations. Similarly, the
size of social networks such as Facebook continues to grow in terms of the number of active
users\footnote{\url{https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/}}.

These growing user bases correspond to growing data sources containing connected data. Taking
insights from this data has the potential to deliver value, which is greatest when the analysis is
most recent, and therefore must be as fast as possible. To support this possibility, we need to be
able to execute timely queries on real time data streams, not just perform offline analysis on
historic snapshots.
