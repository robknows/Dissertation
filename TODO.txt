=== In order ===

- Make both crack_in_x methods return an index onto the base columns for tuple reconstruction.

- Change implementation to work for float columns (may require changes to inclusivity handling)

- Further change it to work for generic types implementing Ord (will be a hard fight vs compiler)

- Using an adjacency list, implement BFS

- Prove correctness for crack_in three and crack_in_two

- Cracked update, insert, delete? Perhaps later for further benchmarks.
