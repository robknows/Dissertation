The analysis of connected data presents a source of significant potential value in recent times, due 
to the increasing prevelance of graph-modelled data sources, such as social media and
internet-connected devices. The rate at which these graphs are growing is unlikely to slow down as 
technology reaches a greater and greater proportion of the world's population, meaning that the cost 
of offline analysis of these graphs will continue to increase.

We present an adaptive solution to graph-data analytics using online edge and vertex clustering, which
acheives comparable performance to pre-processing methods, but with no pre-processing step required. 
We evaluate our techniques against ..., showing that ...
